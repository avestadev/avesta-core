## Building the source

For prerequisites and detailed build instructions please read the
[Installation Instructions](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Building-Ethereum)
on the wiki.

Building avesta requires both a Go (version 1.9 or later) and a C compiler.
You can install them using your favourite package manager.
Once the dependencies are installed, run
   
    git clone  https://github.com/avestadev/avesta-core/ 

    make avestad

or, to build the full suite of utilities:

    make all

## Executables

The go-ethereum project comes with several wrappers/executables found in the `cmd` directory.

| Command    | Description |
|:----------:|-------------|
| **`avestad`** | Our main Ethereum CLI client. It is the entry point into the Ethereum network (main-, test- or private net), capable of running as a full node (default), archive node (retaining all historical state) or a light node (retrieving data live). It can be used by other processes as a gateway into the Ethereum network via JSON RPC endpoints exposed on top of HTTP, WebSocket and/or IPC transports. `avestad --help` and the [CLI Wiki page](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Command-Line-Options) for command line options. |
| `abigen` | Source code generator to convert Ethereum contract definitions into easy to use, compile-time type-safe Go packages. It operates on plain [Ethereum contract ABIs](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-Contract-ABI) with expanded functionality if the contract bytecode is also available. However it also accepts Solidity source files, making development much more streamlined. Please see our [Native DApps](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Native-DApps:-Go-bindings-to-Ethereum-contracts) wiki page for details. |
| `bootnode` | Stripped down version of our Ethereum client implementation that only takes part in the network node discovery protocol, but does not run any of the higher level application protocols. It can be used as a lightweight bootstrap node to aid in finding peers in private networks. |
| `evm` | Developer utility version of the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) that is capable of running bytecode snippets within a configurable environment and execution mode. Its purpose is to allow isolated, fine-grained debugging of EVM opcodes (e.g. `evm --code 60ff60ff --debug`). |
| `gethrpctest` | Developer utility tool to support our [ethereum/rpc-test](https://github.com/ethereum/rpc-tests) test suite which validates baseline conformity to the [Ethereum JSON RPC](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC) specs. Please see the [test suite's readme](https://github.com/ethereum/rpc-tests/blob/master/README.md) for details. |
| `rlpdump` | Developer utility tool to convert binary RLP ([Recursive Length Prefix](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/RLP)) dumps (data encoding used by the Ethereum protocol both network as well as consensus wise) to user friendlier hierarchical representation (e.g. `rlpdump --hex CE0183FFFFFFC4C304050583616263`). |
| `swarm`    | Swarm daemon and tools. This is the entrypoint for the Swarm network. `swarm --help` for command line options and subcommands. See [Swarm README](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/tree/master/swarm) for more information. |
| `puppeth`    | a CLI wizard that aids in creating a new Ethereum network. |

## Running avestad

Going through all the possible command line flags is out of scope here (please consult our
[CLI Wiki page](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Command-Line-Options)), but we've
enumerated a few common parameter combos to get you up to speed quickly on how you can run your
own Avestad instance.

### Full node on the main private Avesta network



```
$ avestad console
```

This command will:

 * Start avestad in fast sync mode (default, can be changed with the `--syncmode` flag), causing it to
   download more data in exchange for avoiding processing the entire history of the Ethereum network,
   which is very CPU intensive.
 * Start up Avestad's built-in interactive [JavaScript console](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/JavaScript-Console),
   (via the trailing `console` subcommand) through which you can invoke all official [`web3` methods](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API)
   as well as Avestad's own [management APIs](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Management-APIs).
   This tool is optional and if you leave it out you can always attach to an already runningAavestad instance
   with `avestad attach`.




 * Instead of using the default data directory (`~/.avestad` on Linux for example), avestad will nest
   itself one level deeper into a `testnet` subfolder (`~/.avestad/testnet` on Linux). Note, on OSX
   and Linux this also means that attaching to a running testnet node requires the use of a custom
   endpoint since `avestad attach` will try to attach to a production node endpoint by default. E.g.
   `avestad attach <datadir>/testnet/geth.ipc`. Windows users are not affected by this.
 * Instead of connecting the main Ethereum network, the client will connect to the test network,
   which uses different P2P bootnodes, different network IDs and genesis states.
   
*Note: Although there are some internal protective measures to prevent transactions from crossing
over between the main network and test network, you should make sure to always use separate accounts
for play-money and real-money. Unless you manually move accounts, Avestad will by default correctly
separate the two networks and will not make any accounts available between them.*


### Configuration

As an alternative to passing the numerous flags to the `avestad` binary, you can also pass a configuration file via:

```
$ avestad --config /path/to/your_config.toml
```

To get an idea how the file should look like you can use the `dumpconfig` subcommand to export your existing configuration:

```
$ avestad --your-favourite-flags dumpconfig
```

*Note: This works only with avestad v1.9.1 ( Thongyod ) fork from geth 1.9
